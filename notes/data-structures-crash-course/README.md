## Complexity Analysis

### Definition

- Complexity Analysis is the process of determining the efficiency of an algorithm.
- We usually measure complexity with **Time** and **Space** complexities.
- It is expressed in **BigO** Notation.
- **BigO Notation:**
    - It is the upper bound (worst-case scenario) of a complexity.

### Time Complexity:

- A measure of how fast an algorithm runs.

### Space Compelxity:

- A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up.
